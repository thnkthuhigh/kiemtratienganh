At 7:45 AM, I leave home and walk to school, which takes about 15 minutes.\n\nAt school, I have six classes every day. My favorite subject is English because our teacher, Ms. Johnson, makes the lessons very interesting. During lunch break, I often play soccer with my friends in the schoolyard.\n\nAfter school ends at 3:00 PM, I go home and have lunch. Then I spend about two hours doing homework. In the evening, I help my mother prepare dinner, and we eat together as a family. Before going to bed, I like to read books or listen to music.",

      "passage": "Reading is one of the most beneficial activities for our minds. When we read regularly, we improve our vocabulary, enhance our critical thinking skills, and expand our knowledge about the world around us.\n\nStudies have shown that people who read frequently have better memory and concentration. Reading also helps reduce stress and can improve our sleep quality. Furthermore, reading fiction books can help us develop empathy by allowing us to understand different perspectives and experiences.\n\nFor students, reading is especially important because it improves academic performance across all subjects. Whether you prefer novels, newspapers, or online articles, the key is to read consistently and choose materials that interest you.",

      "passage": "Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing our planet today. Rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events are clear signs that we need to take action immediately.\n\nThere are many simple ways individuals can help protect the environment. We can reduce energy consumption by turning off lights and electronics when not in use. Using public transportation, walking, or cycling instead of driving helps reduce carbon emissions. Recycling and reducing waste also make a significant difference.\n\nGovernments and businesses also play a crucial role in environmental protection. They can invest in renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, create stricter environmental regulations, and support sustainable practices.",
